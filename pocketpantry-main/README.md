# PocketPantry

## Project Description
This project was designed for use by individuals looking to cook new recipes. It suggests random recipes from an online database, allows a user to search for new recipes, and to filter out recipes that do not match their culinary preferences. It also allows users to save those recipes, or to create a shopping list of recipes, which will automatically populate a shopping list for ingredients.

## Technologies Used

* Kotlin - version 30.0
* Android Studio - version 4.1.3

## Usage
* This project was created as an example. It contains known security flaws, and will not be updated. No important or self-identifying information should be entered into this program.
* This program operates off of a free spoonacular API key. You MUST go to spoonacular, register an account (its free!) and get an API key for your own use. This will allow you to use up to 150 points worth of API calls per day* 


*Note: API calls can be very expensive. Be aware that you can easily run through your quota in a few minutes if you keep refreshing pages or making searches
